To execute please run :
1) Using Dynamic Array:

g++ -O0 -g ROB_dynarr.cpp -o ROB_dynarr

To run for various numbers of #nops intructions, please change line 57 of the code. The code has not been generalized yet
to create all the results togther due to time constraint. Time was spent in explorations. 
The current code runs for 215 nop instructions in the inner loop. 


2) Using Static Array:

g++ -O0 -g ROB_static_arr.cpp -o ROB_static_arr

To run for various numbers of #nops intructions, please change line 57 of the code. The code has not been generalized yet
to create all the results togther due to time constraint. Time was spent in explorations. 
The current code runs for 215 nop instructions in the inner loop.
