To execute please run :

g++ -O0 -g memLevelParallelism.cpp -o memLevelParallelism

To run for various number of memory loads (N), please change in line 58. Current code is setup for N = 1 i.e. one memory load. 
To run for various numbers of #nops intructions, please change line 60 of the code. The code has not been generalized yet
to create all the results togther due to time constraint. Time was spent in explorations. 
The current code runs for 100 nop instructions in the inner loop.
